                <li>1 cup plain yogurt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground cumin</li>
                <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon turmeric</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon chili powder</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
                <li>1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
                <li>1 (14-ounce) can tomato sauce</li>
                <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
                <li>Fresh cilantro, chopped (for garnish)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, lemon juice, cumin, coriander, turmeric, garam masala, chili powder, and salt. Add the chicken pieces and coat well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight for best results.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 tablespoon of butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the chicken pieces and cook until browned on all sides and cooked through, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</li>
                <li>In the same skillet, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter. Add the chopped onion and cook until softened and golden brown, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and ginger and cook for another 1-2 minutes until fragrant.</li>
                <li>Stir in the tomato sauce and bring to a simmer. Cook for about 10 minutes, allowing the sauce to thicken slightly.</li> 
                <li>Reduce the heat to low and stir in the heavy cream. Add the cooked chicken back to the skillet and simmer for an additional 5 minutes, until heated through.</li>
                <li>Serve the butter chicken over rice or with naan, garnished with fresh cilantro.</li>
            </ol>
