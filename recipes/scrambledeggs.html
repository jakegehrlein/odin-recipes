        <h3>They're scrambled eggs. You've had them before. It's amazing you need a recipe for this.</h3>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 large eggs</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk (optional, for creamier eggs)</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter or oil</li>
            <li>Optional toppings: shredded cheese, chopped herbs, diced vegetables, cooked bacon or sausage</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack the eggs into a bowl. Add the milk (if using), salt, and pepper. Whisk until the yolks and whites are fully combined.</li>
            <li>Heat a non-stick skillet over medium-low heat. Add the butter or oil and let it melt, coating the bottom of the pan.</li>
            <li>Pour the egg mixture into the skillet. Let it sit undisturbed for a few seconds until it starts to set around the edges.</li>
            <li>Using a spatula, gently stir the eggs, pushing them from the edges toward the center. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the eggs are mostly set but still slightly runny.</li>
            <li>Remove the skillet from the heat. The residual heat will finish cooking the eggs. If desired, sprinkle with cheese or other toppings and let it melt.</li>
            <li>Serve immediately, garnished with additional herbs or toppings if desired.</li>
        </ol>
